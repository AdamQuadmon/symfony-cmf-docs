# Symfony CMF Documentation

For format, guidelines and planning see the [documentation planning](https://github.com/symfony-cmf/symfony-cmf/wiki/Documentation-Planning).

The documentation is made available on http://symfony.com/doc/master/cmf/index.html and is regenerated
automatically whenever a change is pushed to the master branch on github.

In order to render this documentation locally follow the guidelines on http://readthedocs.org
In short the documentation requires the python tool Sphinx (note not the search engine daemon Sphinx)
to be installed and then generating the documentation should simply require running ``make html``.
